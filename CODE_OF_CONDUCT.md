Community leaders and moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing community standards, and will take corrective action when necessary.

Moderators have the authority and responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject content that violates this Code of Conduct
- Restrict or ban individuals who violate community standards

To encourage accurate reporting of incidents while avoiding retaliation, the privacy of any incident reporter must be respected and preserved to the extent possible while addressing the report.

### 5.2 Reporting Violations

Any community member witnessing or experiencing unacceptable behavior should report it promptly while considering their own safety and well-being.

- Content on a third-party platform such as GitHub or Discord should be reported or flagged using that platform's reporting tools, though note that some platforms may not forward this report to community leaders

- Violations can be reported to community leaders by emailing safeguarding@endlessaccess.org

- Any in-person conduct or safety concerns should be reported to the on-site staff or volunteers

All safeguarding concerns involving minors will be escalated according to the Safeguarding Policy, including to external authorities if necessary.

## 6. Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action that violates this Code of Conduct:

Temporary Ban | Serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior | **Temporary ban** from community spaces for a specified period; violating ban terms may lead to permanent removal
