# Endless Access Community

Weâ€™re building a game-making community around open source video gamesâ€”one where peer-to-peer mentorship, feedback, and shared learning are the norm. Together weâ€™ll build not just skills, but confidence, friendships, and portfolios.

We invite you to join, stick around, contribute, and share. ðŸ§¡
